# randomforest regressor
# --- Step 1: Import necessary libraries ---
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.tree import export_text, plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# --- Step 2: Generate synthetic regression data ---
# 1000 samples, 10 features, and some noise
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, noise=0.2, random_state=42)

# --- Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets ---
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# --- Step 4: Create and train the Random Forest Regressor ---
regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100,random_state=42)
print("No of decision trees in the forest:",regressor.n_estimators)
print("Criterion for decision tree:\n",regressor.criterion)



regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# --- Step 5: Evaluate the model on test data ---
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error:", round(mse, 2))
print("R² Score:", round(r2, 3))

# --- Step 6: Test the model on a new sample ---
# Create a new sample (10 features → same as training data)
new_sample = np.array([[0.5, -1.2, 0.3, 2.1, -0.9, 0.8, 1.0, -0.5, 0.2, -1.0]])

predicted_value = regressor.predict(new_sample)

print("\nNew Sample:", new_sample)
print("Predicted Target Value:", predicted_value[0])

# --- Step 7 (Optional): Display predictions of all trees ---
tree_predictions = [tree.predict(new_sample)[0] for tree in regressor.estimators_]
print("\nPredictions from each Decision Tree:")
print(tree_predictions[:10], "...")  # Show first 10 predictions for brevity

# Average of tree predictions = Final Random Forest prediction
print("\nAverage of all tree predictions:", np.mean(tree_predictions))

# --- Step 9 (Optional): Plot 5 Decision Trees visually ---
