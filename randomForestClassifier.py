# Random forest Classification
# --- Step 1: Import necessary libraries ---
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import tree
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# --- Step 2: Generate synthetic dataset ---
X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=1000,
    n_features=10,
    n_informative=5,
    n_redundant=0,
    random_state=0
)
print(X)
print(y)


# --- Step 3: Split dataset into training and testing sets ---
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0
)
print("Training Data Shape:", X_train.shape)
print("Testing Data Shape:", X_test.shape)


# --- Step 4: Create and initialize the RandomForest Classifier ---
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
print("Number of trees in the forest:", clf.n_estimators)
print("max no. of samples in the subset:", clf.max_samples)
print("Criterion used to construct decision:", clf.criterion)


# --- Step 5: Train the model ---
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)


# --- Step 6: Predict using the trained model ---
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print("Model predicted test data class Labels:\n", y_pred)
print("Actual test data class Labels:\n", y_test)


# --- Step 7: Evaluate model accuracy ---
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy: %.2f" % accuracy)


# --- Step 8: Test the model on a new sample ---
# Create a new sample (10 features → same as training data)
new_sample = np.array([[0.5, -1.2, 0.3, 2.1, -0.9, 0.8, 1.0, -0.5, 0.2, -1.0]])

# Predict the class of the new sample
predicted_class = clf.predict(new_sample)
predicted_prob = clf.predict_proba(new_sample)

# Display the results
print("\nNew Sample:", new_sample)
print("Predicted Class:", predicted_class[0])
print("Predicted Probabilities:", predicted_prob[0])


# --- Step 9: Visualize individual decision trees ---
for i in range(5):   # Visualize first 5 trees
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    tree.plot_tree(
        clf.estimators_[i],
        filled=True,
        feature_names=[f"Feature {j}" for j in range(X.shape[1])],
        class_names=['Class 0', 'Class 1'],
        rounded=True,
        proportion=True,
        fontsize=8
    )
    plt.title(f"Decision Tree {i+1} in the Random Forest")
    plt.show()


# --- Step 10: Display predictions from each individual tree ---
tree_predictions = [estimator.predict(new_sample)[0] for estimator in clf.estimators_]

print("\nPredictions from each of the 100 Decision Trees:")
print(tree_predictions)

from collections import Counter
print("\nVote counts from trees:", Counter(tree_predictions))
